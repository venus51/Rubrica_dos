    <h1>Barranquilla seawall</h1>
    
    <div>Description: The Barranquilla Malecón, officially called Gran Malecón del Río, is one of the most emblematic urban projects in the city. Opened in 2017, it aims to connect Barranquilla with the Magdalena River, recovering its historical relationship with water. Its construction revitalized a deteriorated industrial area, transforming it into a recreational and cultural space with green areas, restaurants, and events.

        Location: It is located on the western bank of Barranquilla, along the Magdalena River, near the city center and the port. It is easily accessible from main roads such as Avenida del Río.</div>
